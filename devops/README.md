## Project Management Tools

This projects uses an internal tool for running commands against the docker compose files.
it should be executed from the root of the project by running `./devops/scripts/manage.py`

it is a terminal UI that allows you to manage the project.

it has the following commands:

- `up` - starts the project
- `down` - stops the project
- `status` - shows the status of the project
- `logs` - shows the logs of the project
- `test` - runs the tests
- `prune` - prunes the project
- `environment` - shows the current environment
